$$Design Techniques Used$$

The Smart Traffic Management System Project uses several DAA techniques to optimize
traffic flow and reduce congestion. These techniques include Dynamic Programming,
Greedy Method, and Backtracking. Dynamic Programming is used to identify the
optimal route for vehicles based on real-time traffic data, while Greedy Method is
used to optimize traffic signal timings. Backtracking is used to resolve conflicts
in traffic flow.
