'''Inputs:
Vehicles
Starting locations for each vehicle
Destinations for each vehicle
Traffic conditions on each route
Outputs:
Assignment of each vehicle to a route
Steps:
 Sort the vehicles by their starting locations.  For each vehicle, find the route with the least amount of traffic using the
Greedy Method technique.  Assign the vehicle to the selected route.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vehicles have been assigned to a route.''' 
#Pseudocode:

function routeAssignment(vehicles, starts, destinations, traffic):
routes = array of available routes
sort vehicles by starting locations
for each vehicle in vehicles:
min_traffic = infinity
selected_route = null
7
for each route in routes:
traffic_on_route = calculateTraffic(route, traffic)
if traffic_on_route < min_traffic:
min_traffic = traffic_on_route
selected_route = route
assign vehicle to selected_route
remove selected_route from routes
return assignments
